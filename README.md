4. Upload code to esp8266.[Link to the code](https://github.com/Firemanpl/ws2812b-automatic-on-lights/blob/master/src/main.cpp) You can use arduino IDE or Visual Studio Code with platorm IO. (If you are going to use VS code with platform IO you can copy the whole project and paste it as a new project)
